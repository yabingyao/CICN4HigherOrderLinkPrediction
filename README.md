## Abstract
In complex networks, traditional link prediction focuses on pairwise interactions between node pairs to predict miss
ing links and identify spurious interactions, which has a wide range of applications in the real world. However, with
 the continuous expansion of network scale, interactions within the network occur not only between pairs of nodes
 but also involve higher-order interactions among multiple nodes. However, traditional link prediction methods face
 challenges in directly predicting these higher-order structures. In this paper, we propose a novel higher-order link pre
diction method based on Clustering mutual Information of Common Neighbors (CICN) for the prediction of 3-cliques
 (triangles). CICN employs node information entropy and calculates the impact of common neighbors by integrating
 different-order clustering coefficients to predict 3-cliques in the network. Experiments on 9 empirical networks show
 that the higher-order clustering patterns of nodes can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting 3-cliques. Ad
ditionally, we investigate the stability of the proposed algorithm and the results indicate that the performance of the
 CICN remains favorable across training sets of varying sizes.
